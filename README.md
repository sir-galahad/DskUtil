# DskUtil
a rather simple utility based on .net to read and write to disk images using Tandy's DECB Filesystem.

As of right now the code for DskUtil works to copy files from a .dsk image and writing files to a .dsk image. Still to do is a major refactoring (while things work all of the code needs a good deal of streamlining.)

While my code seems to work just fine on my machine it would  be wise to make sure you have a back up copy of your .dsk before you attempt any write operations to it.
